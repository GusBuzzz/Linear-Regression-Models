# The Need for Speed: vector vs for loop
# We utilized the NumPy library because it improves speed memory efficiency. Let's demonstrate:
np.random.seed(1)
a = np.random.rand(10000000)  # very large arrays
b = np.random.rand(10000000)

tic = time.time()  # capture start time
c = np.dot(a, b)
toc = time.time()  # capture end time

print(f"np.dot(a, b) =  {c:.4f}")
print(f"Vectorized version duration: {1000*(toc-tic):.4f} ms \n")

del(a);del(b)  #remove these big arrays from memory

'''
So, vectorization provides a large speed up in this example. This is because NumPy makes better use of available data parallelism in the underlying hardware. 
GPU's and modern CPU's implement Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) pipelines allowing multiple operations to be issued in parallel. 
This is critical in Machine Learning where the data sets are often very large.

'''
The previous example used reshape to shape the array.
a = np.arange(6).reshape(-1, 2)
This line of code first created a 1-D Vector of six elements. It then reshaped that vector into a 2-D array using the reshape command. This could have been written:
a = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)
To arrive at the same 3 row, 2 column array. The -1 argument tells the routine to compute the number of rows given the size of the array and the number of columns.
