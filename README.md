Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, allowing us to make predictions based on the learned model.

In this project, we apply linear regression to predict house prices. By training the model on historical house price data with relevant features, we can estimate the price of a house given its characteristics.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files related to linear regression:

GradientDescentLR.py: A python file explaining the concept of gradient descent, a common optimization algorithm used in linear regression.
MultipleVariableLR.py: A python file demonstrating how to perform multiple variable linear regression, which involves multiple input features to predict the target variable.
Vectorization.py: A python file illustrating the concept of vectorization and its significance in enhancing the efficiency of linear regression calculations.
HousePriceModel.py: A Python script showcasing an example implementation of linear regression to predict house prices. It utilizes a dataset containing information about various houses and their corresponding prices.

## Usage
To use the linear regression files in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy code (On terminal) git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression.git
Explore the different files, such as GradientDescentLR.py, MultipleVariableLR.py, and Vectorization.py, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and techniques employed in linear regression.

Run the HousePriceModel.py script as follows:

Copy code (On terminal)
python3 HousePriceModel.py
This script demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using the house price dataset and make predictions on new input data.

Analyze the results and explore further modifications or improvements to the model as needed.
